  voiceLineText: "You can get a subtle entree to such power with this task. This
    time there is way more objects to move. Singular cube on its own lets you to
    move just one object. Somewhat frustrating, isn\u2019t it? I have a solution
    just for that. You just have to soak the room with the essence of the cube. You
    can do that with the use of distribution platforms. Try to place your cube in
    one of them."
