  voiceLineText: Last but not least of our laboratory inventions, gravitational cube.
    It comes with my special core, that enables creation of its own orbit. We believe
    that it is going to be very important to humanity in the future, especially with
    the issues such as orbital accelerators and colonization of new planets. Unfortunately,
    I am unable to show you its full potential, but some day you will be able to
    see it with your own eyes. Laboratory, reduce the orbital power to 2%.
