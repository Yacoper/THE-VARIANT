  voiceLineText: "Fascinating, isn\u2019t it? Humanity for millennia relished in
    depicting symbolism by using violence. Really scary form of emotional presentation
    with incredibly interesting message. Kronos devouring his own children in fear
    of losing his authority, don\u2019t you think that his actions are extremely
    selfish? Annihilating his own progeny in order to strive to often inexplicable
    goals\u2026 Bestiality."
